# Google-Docs-Clone
I built a Google Docs clone using React, Material UI, and Firebase.
If we click any document, it will open up and we can edit them however we need to.
And the most amazing feature is that we can edit a document in real time. This means that if two people are working on the same document, their progress will be reflected in both instances.
